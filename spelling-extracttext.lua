-- ('&#xfb00;').<br />

--- Data structure that stores the text of a document.
-- The data structure that is used to store the text of a document is
-- quite simple.  A document is an ordered list (an array) of
-- paragraphs.  A paragraph is an ordered list (an array) of words.  A
-- word is a single UTF-8 encoded string.<br />
--
-- During the TeX run, node lists are scanned for words.  The words
-- found in a node list are stored in the current paragraph.  After
-- finishing scanning a node list, the current paragraph is inserted
-- into this document data structure.  At the end of the TeX run, all
-- paragraphs of the document are broken into lines of a fixed length
-- and the lines are written to a text file.<br />
--
-- Here's the rationale of this approach:
--
-- <ul>
--
-- <li> It reduces file access _during_ the TeX run by delaying write
--   operations until the end of the TeX run.
--
-- <li> It saves space.  In Lua, strings are internalized.  Since, in a
--   text the same words are used over and over again, relatively few
--   strings are actually stored in memory.
--
-- <li> It allows for pre-processing the document text before writing it
--   to a file.
--
-- </ul>
--
-- @class table
-- @name text_document

-- Create an empty text document.

--- Data structure that stores the words found while scanning a node
--- list corresponding to a paragraph.
-- A paragraph is an ordered list (an array) of words.  A word is a
-- single UTF-8 encoded string.
--
-- @class table
-- @name curr_paragraph

-- Create an empty text paragraph.
local curr_paragraph = {}


--- Data structure that stores the characters of a word while scanning a
--- node list corresponding to a paragraph.
-- The current word data structure is not a plain string, but an ordered
-- list (an array) of the characters of a word.  The characters are
-- collected while scanning a node list.  They are concatenated to a
-- single string only after the end of a word is detected, before
-- inserting the current word into the current paragraph data structure.

--- Finish current paragraph and start a new one.
-- The current paragraph is finished: If non-empty, the current word is
-- appended to the current paragraph, which in turn, if non-empty, is
-- appended to the document structure.  After calling this function, the
-- current word and current paragraph are empty.

### v0.3 (2013-02-12)

New:

  * [LanguageTool][lt] support: LanguageTool error reports in the XML
    format can be parsed for spelling errors (with the help of the
    [LuaXML][luaxml] package).  LanguageTool is a cross-platform style
    and grammar checker.

[luaxml]: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/luaxml

Changes:

  * Default file names used by the package have been changed:

        <jobname>.bad     ==>    <jobname>.spell.bad
        <jobname>.good    ==>    <jobname>.spell.good
        <jobname>.txt     ==>    <jobname>.spell.txt


### v0.2 (2012-12-04)

Fixes:

  * File `spelling.lua` could not be found by LaTeX style file
    ([GitHub issue 14][#14]).
